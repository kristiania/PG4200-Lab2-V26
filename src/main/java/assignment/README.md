## Task 1:  Array operations
### 1) Reverse Traverse 

- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Traverse_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Traverse_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


- Create a method _inReverse_ that returns a copy of the instance variable in reverse ordering (from N to 0). 

### 2) Insert an element in an array.

- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Insert_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Insert_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


#### Insert an element at the starting array index


- Create a method _atStart_ that  inserts a given value at the _beginning_ of an array and returns the resulting array.




#### Insert an element at the ending array index

- Create a method _atEnd_ that  inserts a given value at the _end_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Insert an element at a specified array index

- Create a method _atIndex_ that  inserts a given value at the given index of an array and returns the resulting array.

### 3) Delete an element in an array.


- In this folder (`src/main/java/assignment`), create a class named _Delete_ which will initially only have declared one int array variable.


- Create a constructor inside the _Delete_ class with one parameter of type int [] for setting the instance variable.


#### Delete the element at the starting array index


- Create a method _atStart_ that  deletes the element at the _beginning_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Delete the  element at the ending array index

- Create a method _atEnd_ that  deletes the element at the _end_ of an array and returns the resulting array.


#### Delete the element at a specified array index

- Create a method _atIndex_ that  deletes the element at the given index of an array and returns the resulting array.
